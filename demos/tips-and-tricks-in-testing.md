# Discover cool/useful tricks around testing

## Purpose

Class to share usefull testing  tips and tricks / knowledge.

A lot of the Software Craftsmanship is about (A)TDD, so getting tips is useful

Duration: about 20 minutes

## Instructions

Get the class to

- think of any 2 cool tricks/libraries/usageas of libraries when it comes to test projects.
- put a title for each one on a card, and your initials
- each person briefly presents their card to the class, and sticks it on a wall (remove duplication here)

Once finished

- create 4/5 groups (preferablly pairs)
- divide cards between pairs (maximum 4 cards per pair - give cards to owners)
- They need top prep to demonstrate / walkthough each trick/knowledge on each card
- Give around 10/15 minutes to prep
- 5 minutes presentation time per pair

### Guidance

Anything around

- testing libraries (unit / bdd)
- asserting libraries
- mocking and stubbing libraries

but a bit more interesting than just

- setting up a test
- basic asserts
- AAA
- test start up and tear down
